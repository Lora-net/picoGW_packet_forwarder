Lora network packet forwarder project
======================================

## 1. Core program: lora_pkt_fwd
--------------------------------

The packet forwarder is a program running on the host of a LoRa Picocell gateway
that forwards RF packets receive by the concentrator to a server through a IP/UDP
link, and emits RF packets that are sent by the server.

Uplink: radio packets received by the gateway, with metadata added by the
gateway, forwarded to the server. Might also include gateway status.

Downlink: packets generated by the server, with additional metadata, to be
transmitted by the gateway on the radio channel. Might also include
configuration data for the gateway.

## 2. Helper programs
---------------------

Those programs are included in the project to provide examples on how to 
communicate with the packet forwarder, and to help the system builder use it 
without having to implement a full Lora network server.

### 2.1. util_sink ###

The packet sink is a simple helper program listening on a single port for UDP 
datagrams, and displaying a message each time one is received. The content of 
the datagram itself is ignored.

### 2.2. util_ack ###

The packet acknowledger is a simple helper program listening on a single UDP 
port and responding to PUSH_DATA datagrams with PUSH_ACK, and to PULL_DATA 
datagrams with PULL_ACK.

### 2.3. util_tx_test ###

The network packet sender is a simple helper program used to send packets 
through the gateway-to-server downlink route.

## 3. Helper scripts
--------------------

### 3.1. packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/update_gwid.sh

This script allows automatic update of Gateway_ID with unique MCU ID, in
packet forwarder JSON configuration file.

note: the util_chip_id procided with picoGW_hal repository needs to be compiled
and located in the same directory as this script.

## 4. User Guide
----------------

[A detailed PicoCell GW user guide is available here](https://www.semtech.com/uploads/documents/picocell_gateway_user_guide.pdf)

## 5. Changelog
---------------

### v0.1.0 - 2017-05-03 ###

* Updated lora_pkt_fwd for lgw_connect API change. A new command line option
is available to specify the COM device to be used to access the PicoCell board.

### v0.0.1 - 2017-04-07 ###

* Initial release of the packet forwarder , protocol specifications and helper
programs for Picocell Gateway, based on the packet forwarder of the Gateway
v1.0/v1.5.
